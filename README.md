# list-1, implement fixed-size array list, following the project structure in this repository.
One must implement all operations (functions) declared in list.h,
and the code should be added to list.c 
One can test his/her code in main.c by calling operations ( functions ) in list.h and list.c
For grading, only code in list.c is taken, so one should not put implementation in other source files.
Note: do not make any change to list.h
